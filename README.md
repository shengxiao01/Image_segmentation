# Image Foreground/Background Segmentation using Network Flows

Final project for class BU EC504: Advanced Data Structure

# Functions:
1. Max flow with Edmonds-Karp algorithm
2. Max flow using push-relabel method
3. Max flow using relabel-to-front method
4. Max flow using FIFO method with gap relabelling hurestics
5. Max flow using higest label selection rule with gap relabelling hurestics
6. Multi region segmentation based on GBS
